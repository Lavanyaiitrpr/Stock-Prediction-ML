**Stock Price Prediction Using Machine Learning And Time-Series**

1. Developed a machine learning model to predict future stock prices using historical  stock price data retrieved from Yahoo Finance

2. Engineered features such as moving averages and lagged values to enhance model accuracy

3. Implemented various machine learning models, including Linear Regression, Random Forest, and LSTM networks, to predict stock prices.

4. Integrated the model into a real-time system for live predictions and back tested it using historical data to validate performance.
